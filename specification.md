# Data Analysis - Assignment Specification

The purpose of this assignment is to give you hands-on experience programming in R and answering statistics questions you'll commonly see in your courses at the UW. The primary purpose of this assignment is to familiarize you with best practices according to UW STAT/BIOST faculty.

- For beginners: you'll get to dip your toes into a UW STAT/BIOST style assignment before your first day of class
- For those with experience: you'll get practice with how you should phrase interpretations of statistical concepts in your courses

Everyone will come out with hands-on experience with statistics/R programming, and be able to put what they learned on display publicly (or privately!) using GitHub.

# Overview

It's best to split the work up into multiple days. If you just went through the setup guide, take a break and come back tomorrow!
